## Introduction

A **fully local** AIGC detection desktop tool: drag in a paper (PDF / DOCX / TXT), choose a detection engine, and get the overall AI-written ratio plus a paragraph-level report.

- **Fully offline inference**: the detection model is downloaded once; your paper is never uploaded to any platform
- **Custom model storage path**: keep models on any drive (e.g. D:) so they don't eat C: space; reinstalling the app never deletes downloaded models
- **5 detection engines**: SimpleAI Chinese (default), GLTR perplexity, Fast-DetectGPT, DetectGPT, Binoculars — plus any custom HuggingFace model
- **Models downloaded on demand**: nothing is bundled; grab what you need and stay offline afterwards
- **Benchmarks**: RAID / MGTBench built in, so you can audit your own detection results (accuracy, false-positive rate, per-generator breakdown)
- **Highly customizable**: threshold, paragraph splitting, worker count and more; presets can be saved, exported and imported
- **Multi-device compute pooling**: automatic multi-GPU parallelism on one machine; add roommates' PCs, Pads and phones over LAN
- **Detect → Diagnose → Treat**: after detecting the AI ratio, a fully local rule
  engine diagnoses AI traces (paragraph-level JSON report), then applies
  deterministic rewriting that keeps the academic register
- **Bilingual UI**: the app and installer support one-click switching between 中文 / English
- **Free & open source**: a paid API is reserved, but the core features stay free forever

## Detect → Diagnose → Treat (new in v1.1)

Detection is only the first step. This project merges the methodology of two MIT
open-source projects into a complete loop - **everything runs locally, with no
external AI calls**:

### Diagnosis (local rule engine)

Scans three groups of signals and outputs a **paragraph-level structured JSON report** (exportable):

| Group | What it covers |
|---|---|
| 9-dimension scan | template phrases, burstiness (sentence-length CV), paragraph symmetry, passive voice, nested numbers, colon lists, punctuation, **colloquial warning**, **em-dash density** (the last two are "over-rewriting" gates that protect academic register) |
| CNKI's 5 language patterns | predictable rhythm, uniform density, fixed term position, overlapping connectives, template-functional paragraphs |
| 11 deep AI patterns | significance inflation, synonym cycling, rule of three, copula avoidance, vague attribution, formulaic challenges, suspended analysis, generic conclusions, em-dash overuse, false ranges, paired contrast closures |

Each paragraph gets: risk level, matched patterns with evidence snippets,
sentence-level markers, and suggested actions.

### Treatment (three-round protocol, deterministic rewriting)

1. **Round 1 (subtraction)**: protect spans first (citations, figure/formula
   numbers, data/percentages/P-values, technical terms, quotations - **never
   touched**), then word-level replacements (Chinese AI high-frequency words,
   rotating variants), sentence restructuring, and breaking parallels/numbering;
2. **Round 2 (addition)**: rhythm engineering - deterministic long-sentence
   splitting (target CV ≈ 0.45); **never fabricates facts, data or references**;
3. **Round 3 (self-check)**: Anti-AI audit + register guard - any colloquial/online
   slang must be restored to formal academic language, at most one em-dash per
   paragraph, **register comes before change ratio**.

Four iron rules apply throughout: no full AI rewrite, >40% change only through
structural rewriting and template removal, deterministic replacements, and a
hard academic-register floor.

After detection, if the overall AI ratio exceeds the threshold you set (default
30%, adjustable), the app suggests entering the rewrite flow; you can also click
"Rewrite" at any time.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by my **college-student friend**.

His graduation thesis had to be **re-checked for AI-written ratio again and again** - once per revision - while the official school service is limited and expensive. Hearing his complaints, it hit me: **there is always someone gaming in a dorm, and gaming PCs basically all have dedicated GPUs that can easily run local AI detection**; if one GPU is not enough, link roommates' computers with an Ethernet cable / LAN, or even add **Pads and phones** to the compute pool.

So this project was born: bringing thesis detection **back to local, free and controllable**.

## The 9 integrated methods (all implemented, not just cited)

This project does **not invent its own algorithms** - it implements the following **peer-reviewed** methods as runnable engines or benchmark modules, grouped into Detectors / Rewriters / Benchmarks. No model is bundled; download what you use.

### Detectors (5) - is this text AI-written?

| Project / Paper | How it is implemented here | Links |
|---|---|---|
| **SimpleAI / HC3** (default Chinese engine) | RoBERTa sequence classifier, per-paragraph AI probability; paper "How Close is ChatGPT to Human Experts?" | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07597) · [GitHub](https://github.com/Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-comparison-detection) |
| **GLTR** | Language-model perplexity: PPL ≤ low → 0.85, ≥ high → 0.15, linear in between; from MIT, NeurIPS 2019 | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04043) · [GitHub](https://github.com/HendrikStrobelt/GLTR) |
| **Fast-DetectGPT** | **Implemented per the paper's conditional probability curvature**: the scoring model samples its own perturbations x̃, then we compare `logP(x) − E[logP(x̃)]`; ICLR 2024 | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05130) · [GitHub](https://github.com/baoguangsheng/fast-detect-gpt) |
| **DetectGPT** | **Implemented per the paper's masked perturbation**: T5 refills randomly removed spans to build x̃, then we compare log-probability curvature; zero-shot, Stanford, ICML 2023 (Oral) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11305) · [GitHub](https://github.com/ericmitchell/DetectGPT) |
| **Binoculars** | Cross-perplexity ratio of two same-tokenizer models, `B = logPPL_observer / crossPPL_performer`; lower B means more AI-like; ratio-based, no threshold tuning; ICML 2024 | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12070) · [GitHub](https://github.com/AHans30/Binoculars) |

### Rewriters (2) - diagnose & reduce, built-in rules, no model download

| Project | How it is implemented here | Links |
|---|---|---|
| **aigc-reduce** | The three-round rewrite protocol, implemented in full: 9-dimension scan + AI-frequent word table + colloquial blacklist + protected spans, deterministic rewriting with a register guard. Rules follow the detection principles of CNKI 3.0 / Wanfang / PaperPass / PaperPure | [GitHub](https://github.com/xiaofenggan01/aigc-reduce) |
| **cnki-aigc---skill** | CNKI's 5 language patterns (rhythm / density / term position / connective function / template blocks) as a paragraph-level diagnosis with structured JSON output; that method measured 20.6% → 10.1% | [GitHub](https://github.com/qingshanliuci/cnki-aigc---skill) |

### Benchmarks (2) - audit a detector

| Project / Paper | How it is implemented here | Links |
|---|---|---|
| **RAID** | A runnable benchmark module: accuracy, **false-positive rate** (human text flagged as AI), false-negative rate, and a per-generator breakdown; ACL 2024, 6M+ texts | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09985) · [ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.674/) · [GitHub](https://github.com/liamdugan/raid) |
| **MGTBench** | Precision / recall / F1 over the same labelled set, so detectors can be compared head to head; the first detection benchmark framework for LLMs | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14822) · [GitHub](https://github.com/xinleihe/MGTBench) |

Both benchmarks can **import a subset of the official datasets** (CSV / JSONL) for real evaluation, and export a Markdown report.
The 15 built-in samples are a hand-written smoke test by the author - they are not an official score.

> Separately, the "deep AI patterns" list originates from Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" (WikiProject AI Cleanup), localized by aigc-reduce.
>
> Disclaimer: results depend on the model and text type. They are for self-checking only and are not the verdict of any authority - the official judgement of your school / journal always wins.

## Extending: swap models / add engines (no rebuild needed)

1. **Swap a model**: create `engines_catalog.json` in the install directory and override just the field you want - e.g. move Binoculars to the Falcon pair:
   ```json
   [{"id": "binoculars", "models": [{"repo": "tiiuae/falcon-7b"}, {"repo": "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct"}]}]
   ```
2. **Add an algorithm**: drop a `.py` into `engines_plugins/`, declare it with `@register("my_impl")` and implement `predict_paragraphs()` - it is discovered at startup.
3. **Remote list**: Engine manager → "Check for updates" → paste the URL of an `engines_manifest.json`; new engines / models arrive without upgrading the app.

## Special Thanks (Compute Pooling)

The "multi-device parallel detection" feature borrows ideas from these two open-source projects:

- **[exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo)** (exo-explore/exo, ~46k stars on GitHub): turns everyday devices (phones, Pads, laptops, gaming PCs) into a **P2P distributed AI cluster** with auto-discovery and dynamic model splitting, running large models on ordinary home hardware.
- **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)** (ggml-org/llama.cpp): one of the most popular local LLM inference frameworks; its [RPC distributed inference](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/rpc) splits model layers across heterogeneous devices (e.g. Mac Metal + NVIDIA CUDA), serving as the reference for our cross-device perplexity engines.

Thanks to those projects and their communities for making "dorm compute pooling" possible.

## Special Thanks (Diagnosis & Treatment)

The "Detect → Diagnose → Treat" loop directly merges the methodology of two MIT open-source projects:

- **[aigc-reduce](https://github.com/xiaofenggan01/aigc-reduce)** (xiaofenggan01/aigc-reduce): three-round protocol, replacement tables, Chinese AI high-frequency word lists, colloquial blacklist and 9-dimension scanning methodology. Our rewrite engine follows its rules exactly, insisting "de-AI-ing ≠ colloquializing", with the formal academic register as a hard floor.
- **[cnki-aigc---skill](https://github.com/qingshanliuci/cnki-aigc---skill)** (qingshanliuci/cnki-aigc---skill): a real-world method based on CNKI's "5 language patterns" (measured 20.6% -> 10.1%). Our diagnosis engine follows its patterns.

Thanks to both authors and their communities for making the full detect → diagnose → treat flow possible.
